# Real-Time Detection of Missing and New Objects in Video

This project implements a real-time video analytics pipeline that can detect when objects disappear from a scene and when new objects appear.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
- Object tracking across video frames
- Detection of missing objects (objects that were present but are no longer visible)
- Detection of new objects (objects that were not present before)
- Performance optimization for real-time processing

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- OpenCV
- Ultralytics YOLOv8
- NumPy
- SciPy
